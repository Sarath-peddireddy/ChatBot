My mini chatbot is primarily designed to handle simple queries and perform basic tasks related to reminders. Some examples of questions or commands you can ask the chatbot include:

1. Greetings:
   - "Hello"
   - "Hi"
   - "Hey"

2. Small Talk:
   - "Tell me a joke"
   - "How's the weather?"
   - "Thank you"

3. Getting to Know the Chatbot:
   - "What's your name?"
   - "How are you?"

4. Reminders:
   - "Set a reminder for an appointment"
   - "What reminders do I have?"

5. Exiting the Chatbot:
   - "Goodbye"
   - "Exit"

These are some examples of the questions and commands you can use with the chatbot. Remember that this is a mini chatbot with limited functionality, so it may not be able to handle complex questions or perform advanced tasks.
